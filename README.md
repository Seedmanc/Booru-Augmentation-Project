# Booru Augmentation Project
A userscript that improves usability of basic *.booru.org hosted sites.

It's no secret that free accounts on booru.org offer very little convenience compared to well-developed boorus like Danbooru.  
  My goal is to do what is possible on client-side to compensate for the lack of functionality on the server side.
  
## List of features:

* AJAX tag editor (ready)

Allows you to quickly add, edit and remove tags with just a few clicks and without page reloading. No more scrolling to the bottom of the page to open the edit form, do everything directly in the tag list to the left.

* Drop-down select tag list for the search field (planned)

Kinda like on Danbooru, but probably will only work for the first tag entered. 

* Revamp Statistics area below the tag list (planned)

Improve readability, add user links and image title, remove unnecessary info.

Aside from these, I plan to add some minor tweaks such as fitting the post image into screen width, fixing links to user accounts and some other.

You feedback is required, please go to [Issues](https://github.com/Seedmanc/Booru-Augmentation-Project/issues) section and make suggestions which features I should add, and what would you like to see.
